## Sorting Algorithms

I suggest to go through the algorithms according to its numbering as I ordered it
according to my perception of its complexity in terms of implementation.

### Running the files

Again, there is an assumption that you have a working C compiler. To run any of 
the algorithms, simply run this command (just change algorithm_file_name.c to
your desired file):

`gcc "algorithm_file_name.c" -o main`

You will be greeted by a runtime summary of the algorithms. Do note that the 
runtime will vary because of the randomized nature of `data_loader.h`. 

More specific cases will be added soon to allow for a greater analysis of the
sorting algorithms.
